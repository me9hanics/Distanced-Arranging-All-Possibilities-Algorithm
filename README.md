# Algorithm for all possible index-distanced arrangements 
An algorithm, that prints out for any number *n*, the arrangements of *n* girls and *n* boys (in a line) such that between girl with index *k* and boy with index *k*, there are exactly *k* people. I call these arrangements index-equal distanced arrangements of an *(n,n)-tuple*. 

Such arrangement only exists if *n=4k+3* or *n=4k*. See my proof on that here:

This was inspired by the problem found on the link above.
